# <JavaScript Flashcards>

## I have created a simple flashcard app as a means of reinforcing JavaScript for myself and other new learners. 

- I have a really difficult time learning languages. It doesn't matter if it is spoken, written, or typed into a computer: I do not retain the information easily. This has proven to be especially true of JavaScript for me. 
- While I am starting to be able to write JS by sight with more ease, I still have a hard time with much of the terminology. It's like speaking a language, but being completely unfamiliar with the parts of speach. It makes it difficult to follow instructions, as well as accurately wording a Google search.
- Hopefully some other people will get something out of this, and even add more modules to expand the topics covered. 
- Of course I built this using JS, so as to reinforce everything that I am learning.
